#+title: Docker instructions

* Build and run container

In the examples below Tadashi is build in ~/tadashi~, while the root of
the repo (on the host) is available at ~/workdir~ inside the container.

** Using ~docker-compose~

#+begin_src bash
  docker compose build tadashi

  docker compose run --rm -it tadashi
#+end_src

** If you don't have (an up to date) ~docker-compose~

Build the container with:

#+begin_src bash
  docker build -f tadashi.dockerfile -t tadashi .

  docker run --rm -it -v$(pwd)/../..:/workdir tadashi
#+end_src

* Development notes

Tadashi can be rebuild in the host repo (from within docker) like
this:

#+begin_src bash
mkdir /workdir/build
cd /workdir/build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
#+end_src
