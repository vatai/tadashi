#+title: Run from docker

* Build the image

#+begin_src bash
docker compose build tadashi # build images
#+end_src

* Run the container

#+begin_src bash
docker compose run --rm -it tadashi
#+end_src

The tadashi binds the host repo to ~/workdir~ inside the container.

* Development notes

~ctadashi~ should be rebuilt from the container (i.e. these are
instructions primarily for developers):
#+begin_src bash
mkdir /workdir/build
cd /workdir/build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
#+end_src

The dependencies are built during the ~docker compose build~ command
under ~/tadashi/build/_deps~ and the environment is set up that these
dependencies are used (i.e. they don't need to be rebuilt).
