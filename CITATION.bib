  abstract = {Frameworks and DSLs auto-generating code have traditionally relied on human experts developing them to have in place rigorous methods to assure the legality of the applied code transformations. Machine Learning (ML) is gaining wider adoption as a means to auto-generate code optimised for the hardware target. However, ML solutions, and in particular black-box DNNs, provide no such guarantees on legality. In this paper we propose a library, Tadashi, which leverages the polyhedral model to empower researchers seeking to curate datasets crucial for applying ML in code-generation. Tadashi provides the ability to reliably and practically check the legality of candidate transformations on polyhedral schedules applied on a baseline reference code. We provide a proof that our library guarantees the legality of generated transformations, and demonstrate its lightweight practical cost. Tadashi is available at https://github.com/vatai/tadashi/.},
